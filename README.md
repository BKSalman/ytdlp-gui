# Installation
## Linux

### NixOS (Flake)
you can use the flake.nix in the repo

in your `flake.nix`:
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";

    ytdlp-gui = {
      url = "github:bksalman/ytdlp-gui";
    };
  };

    outputs = { nixpkgs, ytdlp-gui, ...}:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";

      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        overlays = [
          ytdlp-gui.overlay
        ];
      };

# Configuration

For v0.2.2+ the application saves configuration in the default config directory for the respective platform/OS in ``<config_dir>/ytdlp-gui/config.toml``

the default file looks like this:

```toml
# Optional
# This is the directory of the bin, not the bin itself
# bin_path = "<some_cool_path>" # (0.2.4)

bin_dir = "<some_cool_path>" # (0.2.5+) if not set the command will be `yt-dlp <app_args>`

# Optional
download_folder = "<some_cool_path>" # default = "~/Videos"

[options]
video_resolution = "FullHD" # options: "Sd" "Hd" "FullHD" "TwoK" "FourK"
video_format = "Mp4" # options: "Mp4" "Mkv" "Webm"
audio_quality = "Good" # options: "Best" "Good" "Medium" "Low"
audio_format = "Mp3" #  options: "Mp3" "Wav" "Vorbis" "M4a" "Opus"
```

# Contribution
All contribution forms are welcomed, whether it's Pull requests, Issues (bug reports/enhancement requests)

However, I might not be quick to reply to them, or implement the requested stuff, since I'm focusing on other things

But I will do my best üëç
